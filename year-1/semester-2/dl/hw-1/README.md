# DL-HW-1

A repository for the first assignment of my Deep Learning course. The assignment instructions are available [here](DL_HW1.pdf) and the report can be found [here]().

The project represents a simple representation of a neural network, with features such as L2 regularization, SGD and Adam optimizers and learning rate schedule (learning rate decay).
