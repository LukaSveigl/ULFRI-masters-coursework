It all started with malaise which I didn\u2019t think much of initially. However, as the days went by, I began to notice yellow urine I tried to ignore it, hoping it would go away on its own, but it persisted. A couple of weeks ago, extra marital contacts started, and that\u2019s when I became really concerned. I began taking some over-the-counter medications, but they didn\u2019t provide much relief. Recently, spotting urination has also developed, making the situation even worse. I'm finding it increasingly difficult to carry out my daily activities, and my productivity at work has plummeted. I'm constantly tired, irritable, and worried about my health. I've tried various home remedies and even consulted Dr. Google, but nothing seems to help.
